This codebase contains JavaScript files for a simple counter and todo list application.

## Getting Started

To run this codebase, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the application by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Code Structure

The codebase is organized as follows:

- `counter.js`: Contains functions for incrementing and decrementing a counter variable.
- `todo.js`: Contains a function for adding items to a todo list.
- `timer.js`: Contains functions for starting, stopping, and resetting a timer.

## Usage

To use the counter functionality, you can call the `incrementCounter()` and `decrementCounter()` functions from the `counter.js` file. These functions will update the counter variable and display the updated value on the webpage.

To use the todo list functionality, you can call the `addItem()` function from the `todo.js` file. This function takes a string parameter representing the item to be added to the list.

To use the timer functionality, you can call the `startTimer()`, `stopTimer()`, and `resetTimer()` functions from the `timer.js` file. These functions will start, stop, and reset the timer respectively.

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Increment the counter
incrementCounter();

// Decrement the counter
decrementCounter();

// Add an item to the todo list
addItem("Buy groceries");

// Start the timer
startTimer();

// Stop the timer
stopTimer();

// Reset the timer
resetTimer();
```
